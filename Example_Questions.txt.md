1. A car is traveling at a constant speed of 25 m/s around a circular path with a radius of 100 meters. What is the
magnitude of the car's centripetal acceleration?
2. An object with mass of 1.5 kg is attached to a string with radius of 2 meters and is swung around in a horizontal
circle with a speed of 6 meters per second. What is the tension in the string?
3. A cyclist is traveling around a circular path with a radius of 50 meters at a speed of 10 meters per second.
What is the magnitude of the cyclist's centripetal acceleration?
4. An object with a mass of 2 kg is attached to a rope and swung in a circular motion with a radius of 0.5 meters.
If the object is traveling at a constant speed of 10 m/s, what is the magnitude of its centripetal acceleration?
5. A Ferris wheel with a radius of 15 meters rotates at a constant speed of 3 m/s. What is the magnitude of
the centripetal acceleration experienced by a passenger on the Ferris wheel when they are at the top of the wheel?
6. A ball with a mass of 0.5 kg is tied to a string and swung in a horizontal circle with a radius of 1 meter.
If the ball is traveling at a constant speed of 8 m/s, what is the magnitude of its centripetal acceleration?
7. A rollercoaster car is traveling at a constant speed of 20 m/s around a loop-the-loop with a radius of 10 meters.
What is the magnitude of the car's centripetal acceleration at the top of the loop?
8. A ball mass of 500 gram is being whirled in a horizontal circle on the end of a string that is radius of 1.5 meters
long. If the ball is moving at a speed of 2 meters per second, what is the tension in the string?
9. An object mass of 2 kilogram is being swung in a vertical circle on a string that is radius of 3 meters long.
If the object is moving at a speed of 4 meters per second at the top of the circle, what is the tension in the string
at that point?
10. A block mass of 1000 gram is being whirled in a horizontal circle with a radius of 2 meters at a speed of 5 meters
per second. What is the centripetal force acting on the block?
